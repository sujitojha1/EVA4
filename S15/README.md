# Problem Statement EVA 4, Session 15 : DepthMap & Mask Creation

Assignment: 

- Objective: Create a custom/synthetic dataset for traning model to predict depth map and mask. Since the data needed is from RGBD camera and its not available in public dataset, we are create our own custom dataset.

- Target to have 100 background, 100x2 (including flip), and you randomly place the foreground on the background 20 times, you have in total 100x200x20 images.

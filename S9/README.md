# Problem Statement EVA 4, Session9 : CIFAR 10

## Target:

-  Move your last code's transformations to Albumentations. Apply ToTensor, HorizontalFlip, Normalize (at min) + More (for additional points) Please make sure that your test_transforms are simple and only using ToTensor and Normalize
-  Implement GradCam function as a module. Your final code (notebook file) must use imported functions to implement transformations and GradCam functionality
- Target Accuracy is 87%. Submit answers to S9-Assignment-Solution.

## Results

-  Total Parameters = 11,173,962
-  After 20 Epochs, Final Train Accuracy = 88.16%
-  After 20 Epochs, Final Test Accuracy = 87.18%


## Analysis

-  Target accuracy > 87% using Reset18 architecture. Model performance is good as train and test accuracy is small.

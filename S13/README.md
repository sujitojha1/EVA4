# Problem Statement EVA 4, Session12 : Tine Imagenet

## Target:

*  Assignment A:
  1. Download this TINY IMAGENET (Links to an external site.) dataset.
  2. Train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy.
  3. Submit Results. Of course, you are using your own package for everything. You can look at this (Links to an external site.) for reference.

## Results

*  Total Parameters = 11,271,432
*  After 50 Epochs, Final Train Accuracy = 89.47%
*  After 50 Epochs, Final Test Accuracy = 59.12%


## Analysis

*  Target accuracy > 50% using Reset18 new architecture. Model performance is not good as it severly overfitting.

## Target:

* Assignment B:
  1. Download 50 images of dogs. Use this (Links to an external site.) to annotate bounding boxes around the dogs.
  2. Download JSON file.
  3. Describe the contents of this JSON file in FULL details (you don't need to describe all 10 instances, anyone would work).
  4. Refer to this tutorial (Links to an external site.). Find out the best total numbers of clusters. Upload link to your Colab File uploaded to GitHub.

## Results

Total number of clusters (no transformation) = 5
Total number of clusters with log transformation = 5

## Analysis

Total number of cluster of bounding boxes are 5

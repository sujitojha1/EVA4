# Problem Statement EVA 4, Session8 : CIFAR 10

## Target:

Extract the ResNet18 model from this repository and add it to your API/repo.
Use your data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10
Target is 85% accuracy. No limit on the number of epochs. Use default ResNet18 code (so params are fixed).

## Results

Total Parameters = 11,173,962
After 10 Epochs, Final Train Accuracy = 87.90%
After 10 Epochs, Final Test Accuracy = 86.17%

## Analysis

Target accuracy > 85% using Reset18 architecture. Model performance is good as train and test accuracy is small.
